##Aperture
A material design gallery. A direct gateway to your photos. 
===========================================================
Based off of Impression by Aidan Follestad (@afollestad), Aperture was developed for the purpose of making a beautiful, yet non-
distracting Photo Gallery. Right now, it is still in BETA, but more features are coming soon, including Google Drive and Dropbox
intergration, and a photo editor.
