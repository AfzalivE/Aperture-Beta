Forked (with permission) off of *an older build* of Impression by Aidan Follestad, Daniel Ciao, and Marlon Jones, Aperture was developed for the purpose of making a beautiful, yet non-distracting Photo Gallery.

===========================================================
Important: Because of a corrupted keystore, I am unable to update the Google Play version of Aperture. To compensate for this, I 
am currently developing two new versions of Aperture, named Aperture Mini and Aperture 2 (Titles are a WIP) so as of now, *this project is officially DISCONTINUED. Not by choice, 
but due to the circumstances that have happened.* Of course, the Source Code is still free to use, but please respect the GPLv3.
