##Aperture
Important: Even though this project is *oficially* on hold, I am working on a completly new version of Aperture.
===============================================================================================================
Based (with permission) off of Impression by Aidan Follestad (@afollestad), Aperture was developed for the purpose of making a beautiful, yet non-
distracting Photo Gallery. Right now, it is still in BETA, but more features are coming soon, including Google Drive and Dropbox
intergration, and a photo editor. 

Note: This project has been put on hold as I have been asked to help work on Impression, and I am backed up with other projects and School. Due to this, Aperture may not recieve many
more updates. Users of Aperture will be directed to download Impression, but may continue to use Aperture if they so choose to. 
I am also in the process of remaking this app and making it better.
